# Web Application Penetration Testing – Mutillidae & DVWA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a structured web application penetration test against deliberately vulnerable targets including **Mutillidae**, **DVWA**, and **Metasploitable2**.  
The goal was to identify, exploit, and document OWASP Top-10 vulnerabilities using common VAPT methodologies.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, sqlmap
- Kali Linux environment

## 🔍 Key Vulnerabilities Exploited
- SQL Injection (Error-based, Blind)
- Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored)
- File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)
- Cookie Poisoning & Session Hijacking
- Weak Authentication Mechanisms

## 📑 Deliverables
- **Penetration Test Report** with vulnerability details, impact, and remediation steps.
- **Screenshots & Logs** as proof-of-concept for successful exploits.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
- Applied OWASP Top-10 in real-world vulnerable environments.
- Hands-on experience with automated + manual exploitation.
- Produced professional reporting with prioritized recommendations.
